                Preparation
                <ul>
                  <li>Begin with rinsing the mint leaves and keeping them aside.</li>
                  <li>We will use 1 cup tightly packed fresh mint leaves of which half is added to the dough and the other half is added to the spice mix.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <br>
                Kneading dough for pudina paratha
                <ul>
                  <li>Then start with the dough preparation – in a mixing bowl or pan, take 2 cups whole wheat flour (240 grams), 2 teaspoon oil or ghee or butter and ½ to 1 teaspoon salt or add as per taste.</li>
                  <li>Mix very well.</li>
                  <li>Then add ½ cup tightly packed fresh mint leaves (finely chopped). Again mix very well.</li>
                  <li>Now add water in parts. Initially you can add ⅓ to ½ cup water. The amount of water required depends upon the quality of the flour.</li>
                  <li>Mix and begin to knead the dough.</li>
                  <li>Add more water as required and knead to a smooth dough. Overall I used ⅔ cup of water to knead the dough. Depending on the quality of flour, you may need to add more or less water.</li>
                  <li>Knead to a smooth, soft and pliable dough.</li>
                  <li>Cover the bowl with a lid and keep aside for 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <br>
                Making spice mix for pudina paratha
                <ul>
                  <li>In a pan, add ½ cup tightly packed fresh mint leaves.</li>
                  <li>On a low flame or sim with frequent stirs, roast the mint leaves. Some mint leaves will darken, but continue to roast them till they turn crisp.</li>
                  <li>Once the leaves are roasted and dried, then remove and keep aside.</li>
                  <li>In the same pan, add cumin seeds, fennel seeds and roast for half a minute on a low heat.</li>
                  <li>Next add 1 dry red chili, broken and seeds removed. Red chili is optional, but I do add for the bit of heat it provides in the parathas.</li>
                  <li>Roast till the cumin seeds become fragrant. Remove aside and add them in a dry grinder or a spice grinder.</li>
                  <li>When the cumin and fennel seeds become warm or cool down, add the dried mint leaves.</li>
                  <li>Grind to a semi fine mix or a fine powder.</li>
                  <li>Remove in a plate. Also add 1 tablespoon chaat masala powder.</li>
                  <li>Mix both the spice blends very well. Keep aside.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <br>           
                Rolling pudina paratha
                <ul>
                  <li>After 20 to 30 minutes, make medium sized balls of the dough.</li>
                  <li>Take the dough ball on the rolling board and sprinkle some flour on both sides.</li>
                  <li>Roll the ball to a large thin chapati of about 9 to 10 inches.</li>
                  <li>Spread or brush some oil all over. Sprinkle some flour evenly.</li>
                  <li>Now sprinkle the spice mixture that we had prepared.</li>
                  <li>Begin to fold from the edges like a fan with pleats.</li>
                  <li>Fold towards the end and then roll tightly to a circle. Press the loose end at the center downwards.</li>
                  <li>Prepare the pleated roll balls like these and keep aside covered to rest for 12 to 15 minutes.</li>
                  <li>Now take one pleated ball and dust some flour on both sides.</li>
                  <li>Roll to a paratha of about 5 to 6 inches.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <br>
                Cooking pudina paratha
                <ul>
                  <li>Place the paratha on a hot tawa or skillet. Keep the heat medium high or high. Don't roast the paratha on a low heat as then they will become hard or dense and you won't get a good taste.</li>
                  <li>When you see the paratha puffing up at some places and is ¼th cooked then flip with the help of a spatula or tongs.</li>
                  <li>Spread some oil or ghee on this side. The amount of oil or ghee to be applied depends upon your preferences.</li>
                  <li>Flip again and spread some oil or ghee on this side too.</li>
                  <li>Flip a couple of times to get even roasting and cooking of the parathas.</li>
                  <li>Press the edges with a spatula so that they are cooked well. Sometimes the edges are not cooked well so do pay attention on the edges and make sure that they are also cooked well.</li>
                  <li>You can make these parathas more crisp by cooking for some more time.</li>
                  <li>Remove and place the pudina paratha on a plate or tray. Crush them between your palms taking care of the heat, so that the layers separate.</li>
                  <li>The pudina paratha is ready to be served now.</li>
                  <li>Make all pudina paratha this way. If you are unable to serve them immediately, then stack them in a casserole or a roti basket and serve them once you have made all the parathas.</li>
                  <li>Do note that these parathas have to be served hot or warm.</li>
                  <li>Sprinkle the spice mix on top and serve pudina paratha plain with some mango pickle or curd or with a dal fry or a veg curry or gravy.</li>

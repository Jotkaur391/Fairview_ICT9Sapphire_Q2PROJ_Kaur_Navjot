                Making pastry
                <ul>
                  <li>Sieve the whole wheat flour and salt in a mixing bowl.</li>
                  <li>If there is too much of bran in the flour, then sift the flour thrice. You can add salt as per your taste.</li>
                  <li>Now add 5 tablespoons oil.</li>
                  <li>You can also add ghee (clarified butter) if you prefer.</li>
                  <li>With your fingertips rub the oil in the flour to get a breadcrumb like consistency.</li>
                  <li>The whole mixture should clump and hold together when joined. If not then continue to rub the oil or ghee in the flour.</li>
                  <li>Next add ⅓ cup water. Begin to knead adding more water if required. Depending on the quality of flour, you may need to add less or more water.</li>
                  <li>Note that when using all purpose flour less water will be needed. For all purpose flour, simply add 4 to 5 tablespoons first and then add more water if required.</li>
                  <li>Knead to a firm and tight dough. Cover the dough with a moistened napkin or kitchen towel and keep aside for 30 to 40 mins.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <br>
                Making potato stuffing
                <ul>
                  <li>Steam or boil the potatoes until they are fork tender and thoroughly cooked.</li>
                  <li>When the potatoes become warm or cool, peel and chop them in small cubes. You can also add ⅓ cup steamed or boiled green peas to the filling.</li>
                  <li>Crush the green chillies and ginger coarsely in a mortar-pestle.</li>
                  <li>Heat 2 teaspoons oil in small frying pan. Add the cumin seeds and sauté till they splutter.</li>
                  <li>Next add the crushed green chili and ginger paste. Mix well on low heat.</li>
                  <li>Add the red chilli powder and coriander powder. Mix again.</li>
                  <li>Now add the potato cubes. Mix the spices very well with the potatoes.</li>
                  <li>Add garam masala powder, dry mango powder and salt as per taste.</li>
                  <li>Mix everything again very well. Turn off the flame.</li>
                  <li>Lastly add the chopped coriander leaves. Mix the coriander leaves with the aloo stuffing and set aside.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <br>
                Assembling and Shaping
                <ul>
                  <li>After 30 minutes, knead the dough lightly again.</li>
                  <li>Divide the dough into 7 or 8 equal portions.</li>
                  <li>Take a dough piece. Roll it on your palms to make a neat ball and place it on a rolling board.</li>
                  <li>With a rolling pin, roll to a round or circle, keeping the thickness neither thin nor thick.</li>
                  <li>Cut with a knife or a pastry cutter through the center of the samosa pastry.</li>
                  <li>With a brush or with your finger tips, on the straight edge of the sliced dough, apply some water.</li>
                  <li>Join the straight edge, overlapping the two edges a bit.</li>
                  <li>Press the edges well, so that they get sealed.</li>
                  <li>It will look like a cone.</li>
                  <li>Now with a small spoon, stuff the potato filling in the cone. Pinch a part of the samosa cover and seal the base edges. This helps them to stand.</li>
                  <li>Be sure there are no cracks. The edges should be joined very well.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <br>
                Making Baked Samosa
                <ul>
                  <li>Assemble and prepare all samosa this way. As you go on making them, cover them with a kitchen towel so that the outer pastry does not dry out.</li>
                  <li>Before baking, preheat oven at 180 degrees celsius for at least 15 minutes.</li>
                  <li>Place the shaped and prepared samosa on a baking tray.</li>
                  <li>Brush each samosa with some oil.</li>
                  <li>Bake in a preheated oven at 180 degrees C/356 degrees F for 30 to 35 minutes, until the crust is golden and crisp.</li>
                  <li>I baked for 34 minutes. Oven temperatures vary so do keep a check.</li>
                  <li>Allow them to cool down a bit for a couple of minutes as they will be very hot.</li>
                  <li>When they are hot enough to eat, then serve the Baked Samosa with your favorite chutney or dip.</li>
                </ul>

                Making batter
                <ul>
                  <li>In a mixing bowl, take the 1 cup of all purpose flour or maida. Add besan or gram flour, a pinch of baking soda and turmeric powder.</li>
                  <li>Mix all the above dry ingredients with a spoon or spatula.</li>
                  <li>Then add water. The amount of water to be added depends on the quality of flour used. I added 1 cup water. Depending on the quality of flour and besan, you can add from ¾ to 1 cup water.</li>
                  <li>With the spatula or spoon, first mix. Break the small or tiny lumps with the spatula or spoon while mixing.</li>
                  <li>Then in round circular directions stir the batter briskly for 4 minutes. This adds volume to the batter and makes it even and smooth.</li>
                  <li>The batter should have a flowing consistency. Cover and keep the batter to ferment in a warm place for 12 to 15 hours.</li>
                  <li>I kept for 15 hours. If you live in a cold climate, you can keep for 20 to 24 hours and if you live in a hot or warm climate, keep for 6 to 10 hours.</li>
                  <li>After fermentation the batter will have tiny air-pockets in it with a tangy taste.</li>
                  <li>Stir the batter and if you carefully see, the batter would have become thinner than what it was before fermentation.</li>
                  <li>So to thicken the batter again, add 1 to 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour.</li>
                  <li>With a spoon mix very well.</li>
                  <li>Now pour this batter in the squeezy tomato ketchup bottles that we get in the market. You can also use coconut shell and make a small hole in it.</li>
                  <li>You can also use a piping bag or make your own with butter paper. Depending on the capacity of the bottle, you can pour less or more in it.</li>
                </ul>
                Preparing sugar syrup
                <ul>
                  <li>Take 1 cup sugar in a pan. Add saffron strands to it. Do add saffron as it gives a nice orange yellow color and also its aroma to the jalebi.</li>
                  <li>Add ½ cup of water.</li>
                  <li>Keep this pan on stove top on low heat and begin to stir, so that the sugar dissolves.</li>
                  <li>On a low to medium flame, cook the sugar syrup.</li>
                  <li>Cook till you get one string consistency in the sugar syrup.</li>
                  <li>Once you get the one string consistency, switch off the heat and add ¼ tsp lime or lemon juice. Stir well. Keep the sugar syrup on the burner itself so that it remains warm when you add the jalebi in it.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <br>
                Frying jalebi
                <ul>
                  <li>Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan. You can also use ghee or half-half of oil and ghee. Ghee gives a better flavor.</li>
                  <li>To check the temperature of oil, add a tiny amount of batter to the oil. If it comes up quickly and gradually the oil is hot enough for the jalebi to be fried.</li>
                  <li>The frying temperature is 350 degrees Fahrenheit/176 degrees Celsius.</li>
                  <li>Now squeeze the bottle and make concentric rings with the batter.</li>
                  <li>Either start from the center and move outside or vice versa. Be careful while making the jalebis as the oil is hot.</li>
                  <li>You won't get perfect shapes as the jalebis keep on moving while you make the circles.</li>
                  <li>This does require practice and it also depends on what equipment you are using to make them.</li>
                  <li>When one side is partly cooked, turn over and fry the other side.</li>
                  <li>Some jalebi will be cooked faster than others.</li>
                  <li>Fry till the oil stops sizzling and the jalebis are a light golden. Remove with a tongs or a bamboo skewer. While removing shake to drain the extra oil.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <br>
                Adding fried jalebi to sugar syrup
                <ul>
                  <li>Then immediately put the fried jalebis in the sugar syrup. The sugar syrup should be slightly hot or warm when you add the jalebis in it.</li>
                  <li>Turn over after after a minute so that both sides are coated with the syrup.</li>
                  <li>Keep them in the syrup for about 2 to 3 minutes. If you keep for two minutes, they will be lightly colored and if you keep for 3 minutes or more, they will have a deep color.</li>
                  <li>Remove with a wooden skewer or tongs. Shake lightly so that the excess sugar syrup falls back in the pan. Place them in a plate or tray lined with a foil or butter paper.</li>
                  <li>Make all jalebi this way. Its better to have a help while doing so. Otherwise it is kind of multi-tasking.</li>
                  <li>Serve jalebi hot, warm or at room temperature. The leftovers can be kept in an airtight container and refrigerated.</li>
                </ul>

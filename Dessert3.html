                  <li>1 cup + 1 tablespoon water or add as required – the amount of water to be added depends on the quality of besan</li>
                  <li>2 pinches crushed saffron strands or saffron powder</li>
                  <li>½ teaspoon cardamom powder or 5 to 6 green cardamoms crushed to powder in a mortar-pestle</li>
                  <li>1 tablespoon melon seeds (magaz)</li>
                  <li>2 black cardamoms – seeds kept and the husks discarded</li>
                  <li>1 pinch edible camphor – optional</li>
                  <li>1 tablespoon ghee and some more ghee for applying on your palms while shaping the laddu</li>

                Making sugar syrup
                <ul>
                  <li>Mix sugar and water in a pan. Keep the sugar solution on stove top on a low heat.</li>
                  <li>Cook the sugar syrup, till you get a one thread consistency. Stir often. Switch off the heat. Set the sugar solution aside.</li>
                  <li>The sugar syrup should be hot when you add the boondi. So you can keep the sugar solution on a hot water bath by place the pan on a plate or tray filled with hot water. You can choose to fry the boondi and prepare the sugar solution side by side.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <br>
                Making and frying boondi
                <ul>
                  <li>Take the dry ingredients for the boondi batter in a mixing bowl – gram flour and crushed saffron or saffron powder.</li>
                  <li>Add water to make a smooth batter. The consistency of the batter is important. We will check if the consistency is right, by frying a few boondis.</li>
                  <li>Tap the wired whisk or the handle of a spoon which has a bit of batter in to the hot oil. The boondis should have a round shape.</li>
                  <li>If they become flat, the batter is thin and if they get tail ends, the batter is thick.</li>
                  <li>TIP 1: If thin, then add a bit of gram flour and check by frying a few boondi.</li>
                  <li>TIP 2: If thick, then add a bit of water and then do the same test. Once you get the correct consistency, proceed with the next step of frying the boondi.</Li>
                  <li>Take a dry perforated ladle and place it above the hot oil. Don't keep the ladle too much on a height, as the batter droplets, when falling from a height, do not give a round shape.</li>
                  <li>With a spoon add some batter on the perforated spoon ladle.</li>
                  <li>Spread the batter lightly with a spoon. Finish up the batter on the perforated spoon ladle this way.</li>
                  <li>Fry the boondi till they are cooked. Don't make them crisp or over do the frying. When the oil stops sizzling, remove the boondi.</li>
                  <li>This step is also important because if boondi becomes crisp then the boondi ladoo won’t be soft and they won’t be able to absorb the sugar syrup.</li>
                  <li>After each batch, wipe the perforated ladle with a clean piece of kitchen towel from both sides.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <br>
                Making Boondi Laddu
                <ul>
                  <li>Strain the fried boondi well with a slotted spoon and then add them directly to the hot sugar syrup. Fry all the boondi in batches with the above method and then add them to the sugar syrup.</li>
                  <li>Finally add melon seeds (magaz), cardamom powder, black cardamon seeds, ghee and a pinch of edible camphor (optional).</li>
                  <li>Mix well and shape the boondi mixture into a small to medium-sized round spherical ball. If you are not able to shape them, then add 1 to 2 tablespoon more ghee as it helps in binding./li>
                  <li>You can place the boondi ladoo in a small muffin liners. You can also garnish them with raisins or cashews or slivered nuts like almonds or pistachios.</li>
                  <li>Serve boondi laddu. If not serving the same day, refrigerate them in an airtight container. These laddu keep well for about a week in the fridge.</li>

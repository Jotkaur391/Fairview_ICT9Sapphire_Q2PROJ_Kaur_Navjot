                Making Sweet Lassi
                <ul>
                  <li>In a mortar, take the green cardamom pods and crush them lightly. Remove the husks and crush the seeds to a fine powder.</li>
                  <li>In a bowl or pan, take fresh chilled curd (yogurt).</li>
                  <li>With the handheld wooden churner (madani)or blender or wired whisk, simply whisk the curd until it becomes smooth.</li>
                  <li>Add sugar and cold water. You can also add cold milk instead of water.</li>
                  <li>The consistency of this lassi is neither thick nor thin. For a thin lassi, add slightly more water and for a thicker version, add less water.</li>
                  <li>Now churn or beat again with the churner, blender or wired whisk.</li>
                  <li>Keep on churning or whisking until the sugar dissolves and you see a nice frothy layer on top. You can use an immersion blender for the same. Another way is to add all the ingredients in a blender jar and blend until smooth and frothy.</li>
                  <li>Now add the crushed cardamom powder and saffron strands. Mix well. Do check the taste and add more sugar if required.,/li>
                  <li>As a substitute for cardamom powder, add rose water. You can skip all the flavoring ingredients, if you don't have any.</li>
                  <li>Pour lassi in tall glasses and serve. Add a few ice cubes if you prefer. If you want, you can top lassi in each glass with 1 to 2 tablespoons of malai (the thick layer of cream which collects on top of heated milk) or 1 to 2 tablespoons of unsalted white butter (makhan).</li>
                  <li>Garnish with a pinch or two of cardamom powder, 2 to 3 crushed saffron strands or chopped nuts like cashews, pistachios or almonds. Serve sweet punjabi lassi straightaway.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <br>
                Making Salted Lassi
                <ul>
                  <li>Take the curd and water in a bowl or pan. Season with salt and roasted cumin powder.</li>
                  <li>To make your own roasted ground cumin, dry roast cumin seeds in a small skillet or frying pan until fragrant. Then crush in a mortar-pestle or grind finely in a spice-grinder.</li>
                  <li>With a wired whisk blend everything well till smooth. A blender or an immersion blender also works.</li>
                  <li>Pour the salted lassi in glasses. Garnish with mint leaves. You can add a few ice cubes if you like. If you wish to avoid the ice cubes, then make lassi with chilled yogurt and cold water.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <br>
                Making Masala Lassi
                <ul>
                  <li>In a blender take the curd, crushed seeds of the green cardamons, crushed black pepper, grated nutmeg, chopped almonds or cashews or pistachios or a mix of all three nuts.</li>
                  <li>Add the saffron strands and chopped palm jaggery (palm sugar) or jaggery or sugar. Add water.</li>
                  <li>Blend until smooth and frothy. Check the taste and add more palm sugar if needed and blend again. Serve straightaway topped with a few saffron strands or chopped nuts.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>

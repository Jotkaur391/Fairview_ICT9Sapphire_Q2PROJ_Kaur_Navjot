                Making pani puri stuffing
              <br>
              - Boil the potatoes till they are cooked completely.<br>
              - Peel them and then chop them.<br>
              - Finely chop the onion if using it.<br>
              - In a small bowl, mix the potatoes, onions, coriander leaves, cumin powder, chaat masala powder and black salt or regular salt. Mix well and keep aside.<br>
              <br>
              <br>
                Making pani (spiced water)
              <br>
              - In a blender add all the ingredients mentioned above for the pani.<br>
              - Add water and grind to a fine chutney.<br>
              - Remove the green chutney in a large bowl. Rinse the mixer jar with ½ cup water first and then add this water in the bowl. Then add ½ to ¾ cup more water.<br>
              - Mix well. Check the seasoning. Add more salt or jeera powder or chaat masala or jaggery if required. If you want a thin pani, you could add some water. But keep on checking the seasoning, as per your taste.<br>
              - Add the boondi to the pani.<br>
              - You can chill the pani in the fridge or add some ice cubes to it.<br>
              <br>
              <br>
                Assembling pani puri
              <br>
              - Crack the top of the puri with a spoon.<br>
              - Add 2 to 3 teaspoons of the boiled potato-onion filling in the poori.
              - Stir the green pani first and then add it in the poori. Optionally you can add some sweet chutney in the puri.<br>
              - Serve the pani puri immediately otherwise the prepared puri with stuffing and water will become soggy.<br>
              - You can also make individual portions with the puris, potato-onion mixture and the pani. Let the individual assemble the pani puri for himself/herself as per his/her taste.<br>
